git Bash will use MinTTY as terminal emulaator, which sports a resizable windows non-rectangular selection and a Unicode font. Windows  console  programs(such as interactive Python)must be launched via "winpty" to work in MinTTY.

Git will use the default console windows of Windows("cmd.exe"), which works well with win32 console programs such as interactive Python or node.js, but has a very limied defaullt scroll-back, needs to be configured to ouse a Unicode font in order to display non-ASCII character correctly correctly, and  prior to windows 10 its window was not freelly resizable and it only allowed rentangular text selections.
